## ⚙️ Project Overview  
**Chat with PDF** is an intelligent **RAG-based AI document assistant** that lets you *talk to your PDFs*.  
Upload any PDF — reports, policies, academic papers — and get contextual answers instantly.  
It’s built using **LangChain**, **Groq (Mixtral-8×7B)**, and **FAISS**, showcasing real-world deployment skills for **enterprise-grade document intelligence**.

This project demonstrates:
- End-to-end LLM pipeline architecture  
- Secure integration with **Groq APIs**  
- Cloud deployment using **Streamlit**  
- Advanced vector search using **FAISS**  
- Conversational document retrieval and summarization  

---

## 🧠 Key Use Case: *Investment Strategy for Long-Term Wealth*  
The live demo uses a financial strategy PDF as a real-world test case.  
You can ask questions like:
- “What is asset allocation according to this document?”  
- “Why is portfolio rebalancing important?”  
- “Summarize the main principles for long-term investing.”  

The model reads, interprets, and responds with domain-aware financial insights — converting static documents into a personalized learning or analysis experience.
